bugs
-------
still concurrency issues with databases. an activity would appear (db opens) then calls a store to do some db work. if the activity disappears from the foreground, it would call onPause() which will close the db. if this happens before the store starts the db work, then that call will fail. added checks in fav store to return empty values but not sure that's the best way to handle this
